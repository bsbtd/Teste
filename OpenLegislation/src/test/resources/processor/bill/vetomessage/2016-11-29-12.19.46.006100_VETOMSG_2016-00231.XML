                         VETO MESSAGE - No. 231
 
TO THE ASSEMBLY:
 
I am returning herewith, without my approval, the following bill:
 
Assembly Bill Number 1984, entitled:
 
    "AN  ACT to amend the executive law, in relation to requiring parole
      decisions to be published on a website"
 
    NOT APPROVED
 
  This bill would require the Department of   Corrections and  Community
Supervision  (DOCCS) to publish redacted versions of Parole Board appeal
decisions on a searchable database, within sixty days  of  the  decision
being issued.
 
  While  the intentions of this bill are laudable, compliance within the
bill's mandated time frame is not attainable.  The  bill  would  require
DOCCS  to  create an entirely new database and have it fully operational
within thirty days of becoming law. Yet there are multiple security  and
safety  concerns that would need to be addressed, including implementing
safeguards to ensure that victim identities are protected and access  is
appropriately  limited.  Moreover, no funds were appropriated to support
the new database. As such, this proposal is better suited for  consider-
ation during the annual State Budget negotiations.
 
  Despite  my expressed interest in negotiating a workable solution that
would have extended the  effective  date  and  accommodated  appropriate
funding,  the  matter  was not resolved before the bill's delivery. I am
therefore constrained to veto this bill. However, I am  directing  DOCCS
and  the Board of Parole to work with the bill's sponsors and interested
stakeholders to develop a proposal that achieves the  policy  objectives
set forth in this bill.
 
  The bill is disapproved.                    (signed) ANDREW M. CUOMO
